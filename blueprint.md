# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This document outlines the style, design, and features of the Flutter application. It serves as a single source of truth for the project's current state and future development plans.

## Style and Design

The application will adhere to Material Design 3 principles, with a focus on a clean, modern, and intuitive user experience.

*   **Theming:** A centralized `ThemeData` object will define the color scheme, typography, and component styles.
*   **Color Scheme:** A `ColorScheme.fromSeed` will be used to generate a harmonious and accessible color palette.
*   **Typography:** The `google_fonts` package will be used to provide a consistent and legible typography.
*   **Layout:** The application will be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes, working seamlessly on mobile and web.

## Implemented Features

*   **Android Build System Migration:** The Android build system has been migrated to the modern, declarative Gradle plugin system. This provides a more stable and reliable build process.

## Current Plan

The immediate goal is to resolve any remaining build issues and ensure the application can be successfully compiled and run on both Android and web.
